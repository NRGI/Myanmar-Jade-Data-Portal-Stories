# The Finances

This article gives an overview of the money that is involved in Myanmar's jade industry. We will present a primer on how jade is valued, as well as take a look at what the available data says about 

- fluctuations in the price of jade, 
- how much jade is produced, and
- how we can merge data on price and production to look at total value of jade production

A common figure that is cited when talking about the jade industry in Myanmar is the headline figure from Global Witness' 2014 report. According to their investigation, they estimated that in 2014, Myanmar produced $30 billion worth of jade. Below, we will look deeper into how this estimate was produced and also critique it.

## How Jade is Valued

Precious metals such as gold and many types of gems such as diamonds, are valued according to a very standardised method. If you know the purity and weight of gold, you can tell how much moneh it is worth. If you know the certain standard qualities of a diamond, namely color, cut, clarity and carat weight, you can determine its value as well. For jade, it is a much more complicated and varied process.

### Different quality grades and how they are used

What is colloquailly called "jade" can refer to two types of minerals. One called nephrite, which is mainly produced in central America, and another called jadeite, which is the kind that is found in Myanmar. On this website, we will just use the term jade as a shorthand to refer to jadeite mined in Myanmar.

Most of the world's high quality jadeite is mined in Myanmar, and the most flawless stones can approach the price of diamonds (Global Witness 2015, p 24). On the other hand, a lot of the jade that is produced is not of the highest quality, but since the lower grades are mined in larger quantities, they up to very significant values.

Jade is classifed into 3 grades:

- **Imperial jade** is the most valuable and is made into high-end jewellery.
- **Commercial jade** is usually made into carvings and bangles. Depending on how large the stone is, it can be carved into large decorative statues or smaller pieces of jewellery. This is an important point to remember when we look later at how this complicates the pricing of jade.
- **Utility jade** is the lowest grade, and is made into tilings and carvings, as well as cheap jewellery.

Before we can put a figure on the total value of jade that is produced, it is very important to take note that there is a huge variation in the price of the different grades. A bracelet made of imperial jade can be worth millions of dollars, whereas utility jade might not even be valuable enough to bring to market. In addition, within each grade, each individual stone that is mined can also be very different in value, depending on the what kind of final product it could be made into. For example, a stone that is shaped in a way that allows it to be carved into a single statue will fetch a much higher price than a stone of the same weight which is shaped differently and could only be made into bangles. With that in mind, we have to be very careful when assigning prices to aggregated production figures.

### Steps in the Supply Chain

Jade in Myanmar is produced in mining regions of Lonkin-Hpakant in Kachin State and Khamti in Sagaing Region in the north of the country. To the north and north-east, Kachin State is bordered by Yunnan province of China. 

It is estimated that a very significant portion of the jade is sold through unofficial overland channels across the border to China. The official channel is through the Gems and Jade Emporiums that are organised by the Myanmar Gems Enterprise, which is the state owned enterprise which oversees all the gems and jade mining in the country. Most of the jade that go through either of these channels are sold to customers in China.

Jade has to be first washed and then cut to inspect the inside of the stone to give a rough idea of it's quality. That is the only step that is carried out in Myanmar. Beyond the initial cutting, the further steps are carried out in China for most of the valuable stones. In China, depending on the quality, it is then carved into figurines or jewellery, usually in the Yunnan or Guandong provinces of China. The finished products are then sold, mostly to customers in China, through retailers in Yunnan and major cities.


### Price Fluctuations

Demand from China accounts for virtually the entire global market in jade (Shortell 2017, p 12). Moreover, jade is a luxury item that does not have a stable demand but rather it fluctuates depending on tastes and fashion. This means that the price of jade can be highly volatile depending on the whims of Chinese consumers.

Indeed we can see from the data on the average price of jade exports to China that prices can fluctuate immensely from year to year.

## Production

In order to determine how much Myanmar's jade production is worth, idealy we need to know:

* the total volume of production of jade
* a breakdown of that total volume by grade of jade
* the price of each of the grades of jade for each year

Unfortunately, reliable data is hard to come by for all of those categories of data. Instead we will highlight the data sources that are available and look at what insights they can give.

### Myanmar government's reports from Central Statistical Office

Myanmar's Central Statistical Office provides data on a yearly and monthly basis for the total amount of jade that is mined officially.

<iframe id="datawrapper-chart-hZoe2" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/hZoe2/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" oallowfullscreen="oallowfullscreen" msallowfullscreen="msallowfullscreen" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;" height="380"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">if("undefined"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper["hZoe2"]={},window.datawrapper["hZoe2"].embedDeltas={"100":498,"200":422,"300":397,"400":380,"500":380,"600":380,"700":380,"800":380,"900":380,"1000":380},window.datawrapper["hZoe2"].iframe=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-hZoe2"),window.datawrapper["hZoe2"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper["hZoe2"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper["hZoe2"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+"px",window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if("undefined"!=typeof a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var b in a.data["datawrapper-height"])if("hZoe2"==b)window.datawrapper["hZoe2"].iframe.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"});</script>

The problem with this data is that it does not give a breakdown by the grade of the jade. Because the price of jade varies so much depending on grade, the total production figures alone does not help us determine its value.

### Trade figures from UN COMTRADE

One way in which we can get the value of jade is to look at data reported by the UN on the value of official jade exports to China. 

<iframe id="datawrapper-chart-EJjti" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/EJjti/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" oallowfullscreen="oallowfullscreen" msallowfullscreen="msallowfullscreen" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">if("undefined"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper["EJjti"]={},window.datawrapper["EJjti"].embedDeltas={"100":500,"200":425,"300":425,"400":400,"500":400,"600":400,"700":400,"800":400,"900":400,"1000":400},window.datawrapper["EJjti"].iframe=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-EJjti"),window.datawrapper["EJjti"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper["EJjti"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper["EJjti"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+"px",window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if("undefined"!=typeof a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var b in a.data["datawrapper-height"])if("EJjti"==b)window.datawrapper["EJjti"].iframe.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"});</script>

The report produced by Global Witness which claimed that the total production of jade in 2014 could be over $30 billion also used the total value of jade exports from UN COMTRADE to infer the total value of all jade produced in Myanmar. 

### Emporium Sales

In 2017, we received much more detailed information about the jade sales that occured in the official emporiums that are organised by the Myanmar Gems Enterprise, which is the state owned enterprise which overseas all jade production in Myanmar.
