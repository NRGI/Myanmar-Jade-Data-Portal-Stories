              <p>HPAKANT, Kachin State - Roi Awng remembers seeing tigers and other wild animals on mountains with deep green forest during her teen years in the late 1990s. Two decades later, many habitats of these wild animals have turned into a barren landscape scarred by big, deep mining pits. The 32 year old ethnic Kachin woman said thousands of bright yellow trucks and wheel loaders gouging out the earth every day in search of precious jade stones have now replaced reddish-orange with dark striped tigers.</p>
              
							<p>Hpakant is located about four hours of winding drive from Myitkyina, the capital of Kachin State in northern Myanmar. The place, with the look of a small, isolated village, produces the world's top quality jade worth billions of dollars annually. Once we got out of the town, what we saw were roads built with mining waste, mounds of earth tailings dumped by the companies, and mining pits fenced with galvanized iron sheets or mountains which resembled devouring cakes.</p>

              <p>The region is also the epicenter of the decades-long conflict between Myanmar's military and the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO), one of the most powerful ethnic armed groups in the country. Both groups profit from concession fees and informal taxes imposed on the mining companies. The meagre spoils of the industry are divided between the locals and the itinerant illegal miners and scavengers who migrated from different impoverished regions across the country, mainly Rakhine State. The 2014 census data suggests that Hpakant has a total of 331,708 people living in the area and nearly 300,000 among them are migrant miners according to the estimates of local lawmakers and activists. Very little benefit from the jade trade eventually trickle down local communities, which call the industry "the resource curse."  </p>

              <br/>
              <p>The landscape, once surrounded by hills and mountains, started changing in 1994 when the KIO signed a ceasefire agreement with the then-ruling military junta, opening up the region to mineral extraction. However, it was after 2010 when the geography started changing unrecognizably due to the increase of large-scale mining under U Thein Sein's government. </p>
              
              <!-- <img src="assets/img/environment/envi_02.jpg" width="100%"/><br/> -->


              <p>This time period also coincided with the resumption of armed clashes between the military and the KIO in 2011 where the latter lost much of its influence in Hpakant, leading to the increasing government control over licensing for jade mining. The government also restricts foreigners from traveling to the jade-rich town, effectively warding off scrutiny of the murky trade from the outside world. The actual size of Myanmar's jade industry is hard to estimate and researches by various organizations present <a href="http://openjadedata.org/Stories/how_much_jade_worth.html">a wide range</a>. It is, however, clear that the local communities lose far more in the deteriorating quality of life from subsequent environmental degradation compared to the little they gain from the jade revenues. </p> 
              
              <h3>Moving mountains and villages for big companies</h3>

              <p>Hpakant's geographical shape is utterly changing every week as the companies blast away mountains using dynamites to look for jade underneath the earth. The scale of transformation is very significant that the native motorcycle driver for my field trip who is familiar with Hpakant's geography got lost multiple times in the middle of deep mining pits. </p>

              <p>As mining activities expand, it is not uncommon for residents to be forced off their land to make way for big mining companies. Mopin village where Roi Awng has been living since 1996 has been moved twice, in 2009 and then again in 2015, from its original location. According to the data reported in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) report for FY 2015-16, nine private companies were awarded mining licenses to operate between 2011 to 2015 in the area of Mopin. </p>



              <!-- <img src="assets/img/environment/envi_03.jpg" width="100%"/><br/> -->
              
              <!-- <img src="assets/img/environment/envi_04.jpg" width="100%"/><br/> -->
              






              <p>In late 2015, the mining company that operated in the area of her village (not named in this article at Roi Seng's request due to her fears of retaliation) compensated her family 40 million kyats (approximately USD 31,000 at the exchange rate in that period) for the relocation. Using heavy loads of earth and rock tailings from their mines, the company made flat land for the new village site and built roads for their vehicles to drive to the operation sites.</p>

              <p>Locals from various places I talked to during my trip in March 2018 shared similar experience of having to relocate multiple times over the past years. Compensation rates, if at all given, are often arbitrary. Thayagone, another village in Hpakant, has moved from its original location three times between 1992 and 2018. With some 200 households of over 700 residents, the village now sits between two mountains and in close proximity to the deep mining pits. When the residents had to move for the second time in 2007, they were compensated between 1.5 and 3 million kyats (USD 1,150 - 2,300, at the exchange rate in that period) depending on the condition of their houses.</p>

              <h3>Frequent landslides claiming hundreds of lives </h3>

              <p>Not far from Thayagone village, residents of Thekegone village also moved to the current location about ten years ago but they are now being forced asked to relocate yet again. Mining companies are operating right at the foot of the mountain on which the village sits. About 20 houses had collapsed along the slope in early 2018 because of a landslide. I saw small parts from the mountain edge falling off as I hiked up the mountain. It was evident the deteriorating landscape posed imminent danger to the residents, who have yet to reach an agreement with mining companies on the compensation amount. Apart from the relocation, possibility of being buried under an avalanche of mud and waste from jade mining is yet another factor that adds to the uncertainty.  </p>


              <!--<Landslide vid 1>-->
              <div class='videoblock'>
                  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Iyd2Rk0xXI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
              </div>
                    

              <p></p>

              <p>The standard size for each jade mining plot for private companies in Myanmar is one acre. The rationale of this is arguably to prevent large-scale mining but companies operating in Myanmar's jade sector bypass this loophole by securing several neighboring licenses.  For instance, the EITI data for FY 2015-16 shows that Samar area in Lone Khin region has a total of 70 valid licenses. They are held by only two companies, namely Saung Tar Yar Star and Phu Sha Star at 50 and 20 licenses respectively. All of these licenses are granted at the same time for the same period, that is in early 2016 for a period of three years with the expiry dates in early 2019. </p>

              <p>In addition to failing to achieve its original purpose, the size limit also made it impossible for jade producers to incorporate a mine plan. One visible consequence of this are random heaps of mine waste that scar the landscape of Hpakant. Although there are at least ten areas in Hpakant region designated by the government for companies to discharge their mining waste, they are inadequate for the extent of mining activity that's taking place and the amount of earth the companies gouge out every day. Combined with the distance from the mines and lax monitoring, it is common for dumping trucks to offload their content where convenient. </p>

              <p>Dynamite explosions and heavy rain can easily trigger these loose heaps of slag, some of hundreds of feet high, into large-scale landslides which now happen frequently in Hpakant. Several landslides over the past years have buried alive hundreds of lives of workers hired by mining companies as well as scavengers. Between January 2015 and July 2018, at least 245 deaths from landslides have been recorded but the actual number is likely much higher. The biggest incident in November 2015 at Kan Hkar village claimed at least 113 lives, with another 100 workers whose bodies have not been founded recorded as "missing". </p>

              <!-- <p>There are several other villages in Hpakant that had faced and are still facing the same threat. Thayagone village is one of the places that had to relocate multiple times over the past years. It had moved from its original location three times between 1992 and 2018. With some 200 households of over 700 residents, the village now sits between two mountains in a close proximity to the deep mining pits. When the residents had to move for the second time in 2007, they were compensated between 1.5 and 3 million kyats depending on the condition of their houses.</p>

              <p>When I visited Hpakant in March, Thekegone village residents had been informed to move from the existing location as soon as possible because mining companies are operating right at the foot of the mountain on which the village sits. </p>

              <p>The mountain is gradually deteriorating. I saw small parts from the edges of the mountain were falling off as I went up to it. I was told that residents and the companies have yet to agree on the compensation amount for the relocation. The village has been sitting there for about 10 years. Recently, about 20 houses were collapsed because of the mountain landslide. </p>

              <img src="assets/img/environment/envi_14.jpg" width="100%"/><br/>

              <p>Kahtan village. Originally situated at the foot of a mountain, Kahtan village had to move onto a heap of mine tailings nearby in 2009. Residents didn’t get much compensation for their relocation.</p>


              <h3>Hpakant, the Town of Resource Curse</h3>

              <p>Hpakant looks more like a small, isolated village than the center of a multi-billion dollars industry. Once we got out of the town, what we saw is either roads built with mining waste or mounds of earth tailings dumped by the companies if it’s not mining pits fenced with galvanized iron sheets or mountains that resembled to devouring cakes. One thing I constantly heard from locals I spoke to in mining areas was, “we live on one big mound of jade mining waste,”without knowing when they will need to relocate again, and being cautious of landslides.</p>

              <p>The 2014 census data suggests that Hpakant has a total of 331,708 people living in the area. However, local lawmakers and activists estimated that only the number of itinerant illegal miners and scavengers who migrated from different impoverished regions across the country, mainly Rakhine State, looking for jade remnants can be nearly 300,000.   </p>

              <h3>Scavengers Dream Big in Hpakant</h3>

              <p>Having heard stories of jade mining opportunities, 38-year-old La Nan abandoned hisfarm in Mogaung and moved to Thayagone village in 2000 to pursue the dream of getting rich quickly by finding a jade stone.</p>

              <p>Back in the days, life was comfortable for him. There were only a few small-scale mining companies and miners like him were able find valuable jade stones more often than now. With increasing large-scale extractions, scavengers like him are allowed to inspect only a few hours every day in the pits owned by the mining companies.</p>

              <p>Not having regular earnings from searching in the mine rubble, the family relies on his wife who works as a kindergarten school teacher with the salary of 90,000 kyats monthly.</p>

              <p>“There is no assurance for our life here,” La Nan said, adding that people in Hpakant have no other job opportunities except from working in jade mining sites. </p>

              <p>When asked if he liked companies operate large-scale mining in Hpakant, he preferred large-scale mining be banned, he said.</p>

              <p>“It is rare for scavengers like us to even find one valuable raw stone in two months,” he said adding that they could only inspect with a two-feet long small hammer inside companies’ pits while companies use heavy machines and equipment to gouge out the earth. </p>

              <p>Unlike him, his village administrator has positive opinion about the mining companies.He thinks large-scale mining is beneficial for locals as they can go inspect inside the companies’ mining pits and can easily find stones after they extract with heavy machines.</p>

              <p>Many mining workers and scavengers have become addicted to methamphetamine and heroin because drug is available abundantly and cheaply in Hpakant. Sometimes, their bosses give them drugs expecting longer hours of work from them. Gambling tables are seen regularly inside the shelters of workers as gambling the only available entertainment option for them in the area.</p>

              <p>KoMoe Kyaw, 49, who migrated to Hpakant from Pokkaku since 1990 said his last 28years in jade mining industry was not something he expected to happen.</p>

              <p>“Iplanned to quit the industry and start another business once I get enoughcapital. But it’s still not happening,” he said.</p>

              <p>He blamed the government for not being able to systematically manage the jade mining industry and collect tax from the mining companies effectively.</p>

              <p>“If it’s a systematic industry, I will definitely pay tax to the government and sell the jade directly in foreign market,” he said.</p> -->

              <h3>Pollution of Water and Air</h3>

              <p>Some of these waste also gets dumped directly into the Uru Creek that runs right through the heart of Hpakant, its more than 23 tributaries or onto their banks. Hpakant lawmaker U Tint San and Ko Naung Latt, the local environmental activist, said over a dozen tributaries have disappeared and the the floor of the Uru has risen over 20 feet since the 1990s as a result of dumping. "Back in the days, we could see rocks at the floor of the Uru through its crystal clear water. Fishes were abundant," U Tint Soe said. "Now the floor has risen and the water became very muddy as you can see," he added. Flooding of villages along the creek during the monsoon reasons is now common. </p>

              <p>One immediate consequence of pollution in Hpakant's waterbodies from waste dumping at the moment is difficult accessibility to clean water. There are only one or two places left where the water is still relatively clear. Scarcity of underground water, especially in areas where the villages are randomly located to, means the locals have to resort to storing rain water in old pits during the rainy season for daily use all year round. They are then distributed through pipes by pumping by the initiative of the residents, some mining companies as a social project for villagers or some of the locals running it as a profit-making business.  A family of three uses at least two units of water every day, which costs them 4,000 kyats (USD 2.6), where the official minimum wage of an adult is set at 4,800 kyats. </p>

              <p>While there is no research done by individual or organization testing water and air quality in Hpakant according to Ko Naung Latt, the urgency to do so is apparent. The Myanmar government has issued a suspension over issuing new licenses and renewing existing ones in July 2016. However, the land in Hpakant is already so barren that it may take decades to rectify the environmental damage caused by decades of mining under poor management.</p>

              <p>By the look of Hpakant today, it is hard to believe that Hpakant was once a town surrounded by mountain ranges and deep forests. In the place of mountains which have been picked apart, now stands open-pit mines and mounds made of mining waste. Forests have been cleared out to make way for dusty roads filled with dump trucks and wheel loaders. Its main water source Uru Creek became a muddy stream that occasionally foods the town.   </p>

              <p>Pointing at some of the few remaining mountains near a mining site, my motorcycle driver said, "See all the mountains there? They might all be gone by the time you come here again." He was not exaggerating. Roi Awng told me during my interview with her that Hpakant's future was full of uncertainty. "Nobody knows when we have to move again from this place to make way for another mining company," she grumbled. </p>
