              <p>HPAKANT, Kachin State — Roi Awng remembers seeing tigers and other wild animals on mountains with deep green forest during her teen years in the late 1990s. Two decades later, many habitats of these wild animals have turned into a barren landscape scarred by big, deep mining pits. Instead of reddish-orange with dark striped tigers, the 32-year-old ethnic Kachin woman now sees thousands of bright yellow trucks and wheel loaders gouging out the earth every day in search of precious jade stones.</p>
              
							<p>Hpakant—about four hours of winding drive from Kachin State’s capital Myitkyina in northern Myanmar— is home to billions-dollar worth jade industry and the source of world’s top quality jade.</p>

              <p>While the government and the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO), one of the most powerful ethnic armed groups fighting with the government army, were dividing the spoils of a lucrative industry, both profiting from through concession fees and taxes, locals lost far more than they gained. With little law enforcement and the help of venal government officials, majority of these jade stones are believed to be illegally traded to China where the market is the biggest for jade.</p>

              <p>Once surrounded by hills and mountains, Hpakant’s landscape started changing when the KIO signed a ceasefire agreement with the then ruling military junta in 1994, opening up the region to mineral extraction. But it got worsen unrecognizably after 2010 due to the increase of large-scale mining under U Thein Sein government. Since armed clashes resumed in the state in 2011, the KIO has lost much of its influence in Hpakant. The government also restricts foreigners from traveling to the jade-rich town. </p>
              
              <img src="assets/img/environment/envi_02.jpg" width="100%"/><br/>


              <p>According to 2015-16 EITI report, there are 15,234 licenses of private ownership and 271 of joint venture licenses awarded for jade and gemstone mining only in Kachin State. A 2015 report by Global Witness estimated the total value of jade sector in 2014 to between USD 5 billion and USD 31 billion. The latter value was approximately the 50 percent of the country’s GDP at the time. But, the mineral wealth is mostly reaped by cronies and businessmen who have links to the military or armed groups.</p>

              <p>As there is so little benefit from their own natural resource, ethnic locals call the industry “the resource curse.” Like many other places in the country, many were forced off their land to make way for big companies, often with little compensation.</p>

              <p>Nowadays,Hpakant’s geographical shape is utterly changing every week as the companies blast away mountains using dynamites to look for jade underneath the earth. The scale of transformation is very significant that the local miner who guided me in the area with a motorbike got lost multiple times in the middle of deep mining pits.</p>

              <p>Mopin village where Roi Awng has been living since 1996 has been moved twice so far from its original location in 2009 and 2015 to make way for the mining companies. From 2011 to 2015, a total of nine private companies were awarded mining licenses to operate in the area of Mopin, including Seine Lé Yadanar Win and Mya Seine Taung companies, according to 2015-16 EITI report.</p>

              <p>“Most of the mountains had become jade mine tailings or mining pits,” Roi Awng said.</p>

              <p>Many locals I spoke to during my trip in March shared similar experience. In late2015, the mining company that operated in the area of her village compensated her family 40 million kyats for the relocation. Using heavy loads of earth and rock tailings from their mines, the company made flat land on which the families could relocate to, and built roads so that their trucks and wheel loaders can be driven in the mining areas.</p>
              
              <img src="assets/img/environment/envi_05.jpg" width="100%"/><br/>


              <p>Dynamite explosions and heavy rain usually trigger the landslides as heaps of mining waste are not pressed together to be compact. That is one of the reasons why Hpakant is very vulnerable to landslide. Several landslides happened over the past years claimed hundreds of lives of scavengers and those who were working in mining pits. </p>
<!--<Landslide vid 1>-->

              <p>Workers at many of Hpakant’s jade mines are at risk of being buried alive under slag heaps, some of which are hundreds of feet high. There were more than 200 people died in Hpakant landslides happened between 2015 and 2018.</p>

              <p>The one with highest casualties happened in November 2015 at Kan Hkar village. At least 113 people died and more than 100 went missing.</p>

              <p>There are several other villages in Hpakant that had faced and are still facing the same threat. Thayagone village is one of the places that had to relocate multiple times over the past years. It had moved from its original location three times between 1992 and 2018. With some 200 households of over 700 residents, the village now sits between two mountains in a close proximity to the deep mining pits. When the residents had to move for the second time in 2007, they were compensated between 1.5 and 3 million kyats depending on the condition of their houses.</p>

              <p>When I visited Hpakant in March, Thekegone village residents had been informed to move from the existing location as soon as possible because mining companies are operating right at the foot of the mountain on which the village sits. </p>

              <p>The mountain is gradually deteriorating. I saw small parts from the edges of the mountain were falling off as I went up to it. I was told that residents and the companies have yet to agree on the compensation amount for the relocation. The village has been sitting there for about 10 years. Recently, about 20 houses were collapsed because of the mountain landslide. </p>

              <img src="assets/img/environment/envi_14.jpg" width="100%"/><br/>

              <p>Kahtan village. Originally situated at the foot of a mountain, Kahtan village had to move onto a heap of mine tailings nearby in 2009. Residents didn’t get much compensation for their relocation.</p>

              <h3>Hpakant, the Town of Resource Curse</h3>

              <p>Hpakant looks more like a small, isolated village than the center of a multi-billion dollars industry. Once we got out of the town, what we saw is either roads built with mining waste or mounds of earth tailings dumped by the companies if it’s not mining pits fenced with galvanized iron sheets or mountains that resembled to devouring cakes. One thing I constantly heard from locals I spoke to in mining areas was, “we live on one big mound of jade mining waste,”without knowing when they will need to relocate again, and being cautious of landslides.</p>

              <p>The 2014 census data suggests that Hpakant has a total of 331,708 people living in the area. However, local lawmakers and activists estimated that only the number of itinerant illegal miners and scavengers who migrated from different impoverished regions across the country, mainly Rakhine State, looking for jade remnants can be nearly 300,000.   </p>


              <img src="assets/img/environment/envi_15.jpg" width="100%"/><br/>
              <p>Hpakant</p>

              <h3>Scavengers Dream Big in Hpakant</h3>

              <p>Having heard stories of jade mining opportunities, 38-year-old La Nan abandoned hisfarm in Mogaung and moved to Thayagone village in 2000 to pursue the dream of getting rich quickly by finding a jade stone.</p>

              <p>Back in the days, life was comfortable for him. There were only a few small-scale mining companies and miners like him were able find valuable jade stones more often than now. With increasing large-scale extractions, scavengers like him are allowed to inspect only a few hours every day in the pits owned by the mining companies.</p>

              <p>Not having regular earnings from searching in the mine rubble, the family relies on his wife who works as a kindergarten school teacher with the salary of 90,000 kyats monthly.</p>

              <p>“There is no assurance for our life here,” La Nan said, adding that people in Hpakant have no other job opportunities except from working in jade mining sites. </p>


              <img src="assets/img/environment/envi_16.jpg" width="100%"/><br/>
              <p>La Nan talking about his life. </p>




              <p>When asked if he liked companies operate large-scale mining in Hpakant, he preferred large-scale mining be banned, he said.</p>

              <p>“It is rare for scavengers like us to even find one valuable raw stone in two months,” he said adding that they could only inspect with a two-feet long small hammer inside companies’ pits while companies use heavy machines and equipment to gouge out the earth. </p>

              <p>Unlike him, his village administrator has positive opinion about the mining companies.He thinks large-scale mining is beneficial for locals as they can go inspect inside the companies’ mining pits and can easily find stones after they extract with heavy machines.</p>

              <p>Many mining workers and scavengers have become addicted to methamphetamine and heroin because drug is available abundantly and cheaply in Hpakant. Sometimes, their bosses give them drugs expecting longer hours of work from them. Gambling tables are seen regularly inside the shelters of workers as gambling the only available entertainment option for them in the area.</p>

              <p>KoMoe Kyaw, 49, who migrated to Hpakant from Pokkaku since 1990 said his last 28years in jade mining industry was not something he expected to happen.</p>

              <p>“Iplanned to quit the industry and start another business once I get enoughcapital. But it’s still not happening,” he said.</p>


              <img src="assets/img/environment/envi_17.jpg" width="100%"/><br/>
              <p>Ko Moe Kyaw sits inside his house in Kaung San Village.</p>

              <p>He blamed the government for not being able to systematically manage the jade mining industry and collect tax from the mining companies effectively.</p>

              <p>“If it’s a systematic industry, I will definitely pay tax to the government and sell the jade directly in foreign market,” he said.</p>

              <h3>Pollution of Water and Air</h3>

              <p>Apart from the massive geographical transformation, there are also other negative factors that large-scale mining has impacted Hpakant and its people—scarcity of groundwater and bad air quality. With lack of proper water management plans and poorly regulated mining laws, residents who live near mining sites can’t have access to groundwater.</p>

              <p>For their daily purposes, locals use the rain water stored in old pits during rainy season and distributed through pipes by pumping. It costs 2,000 kyats per one unit and a family of three uses at least two units of water every day, according to workers and villagers living in close proximity of mining sites. </p>


              <img src="assets/img/environment/envi_18.jpg" width="100%"/><br/>
              <img src="assets/img/environment/envi_19.jpg" width="100%"/><br/>






              <p>Even though authorities set at least 10 specific places for companies to discharge their mining waste, some companies discharge their mining waste directly into the Uru Creek that runs right through the heart of Hpakant or onto its banks. It is either because the places are too far away from their mining sites or the amount of earth the companies gouge out every day is far beyond the capacity of designated waste sites. Such actions pollute the creek water and rise up the creek’s floor which cause flooding to the villages along the creek during monsoon season. </p>





              <img src="assets/img/environment/envi_20.jpg" width="100%"/><br/>

              <img src="assets/img/environment/envi_22.jpg" width="100%"/><br/>






              <p>At the end of the day, those who have to suffer from such lack of proper management are the Uru Creek and Hpakant locals. There used to be about 23 tributaries that flew into Uru Creek but over a dozen have disappeared due to mining waste heaps dumped into these tributaries or onto the banks. Hpakant lawmaker U Tint San and Ko Naung Latt, the local environmental activist, said the floor of Uru Creek has risen over 20 feet.</p>

              <p>“Back in the days, we could see rocks at the floor of the Uru Creek through its crystal clear water. Fishes were abundant,” U Tint Soe said. “Now the floor has risen and the water became very muddy as you can see,” he added.</p>

              <p>There is only one or two places left where the water is still relatively clean—near Maw Pone area. </p>

              <p>While there is no research done by individual or organization testing water and air quality in Hpakant according to Ko Naung Latt, the urgency to do so is apparent. Even if the government halts giving mining licenses to companies and restricts all the operations when the licenses expire, the land in Hpakant is already so barren that it may take years and years to cure the environmental damage caused by decades of mining under poor management.</p>
