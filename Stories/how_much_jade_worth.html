							<p>In 2015, the international NGO <a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/">Global Witness</a> published a report called <a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/oil-gas-and-mining/myanmarjade/">Jade: Myanmar's "Big State Secret"</a>, in which they estimated the total value of Myanmar's jade industry in 2014 to between US$5 billion and US$31 billion – with the higher estimate roughly equal to 50% of the country's GDP.</p>
              <p>That same year, Myanmar's first <a href="https://eiti.org/document/myanmar-20132014-eiti-report">EITI (Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative) report</a> was released, which stated that US$1.5 billion of jade was sold at official emporiums in 2014.</p>
              
              <img src="assets/img/Myanmar_jade_GDP.png" width="100%"/><br/>
              
              <p>This big difference between the two numbers show just how difficult it is to estimate the total value of Myanmar's jade industry. Clear and definitive data about the sector is very hard to find, and most estimates rely on a lot of assumptions.</p>
              
              <p>There have also been other attempts to estimate the total value of Myanmar's jade industry. In 2013, a <a href="https://proximitydesigns.org/wp-content/uploads/creating.pdf">collaborative research project</a> between Havard University's <a href="https://ash.harvard.edu/">Ash Center</a> and Myanmar social enterprise <a href="https://proximitydesigns.org/">Proximity Designs</a> estimated the value to be US$ 8 billion a year. <a href="https://proximitydesigns.org/wp-content/uploads/20160815_a_grand_bargain_eng_oct_24.2016.pdf">Another study</a> by the same two organisations in 2016 estimated the value to be US$15 billion.</p>
              
              <p>A lot of the discrepency between these estimates stems from the fact that a lot of jade is never reported to the government. Estimating prices and quantities produced when significant amounts of jade leave the country illicitly is difficult.</p>
              
              <p>In this article, we will visually demonstrate how such estimates are calculated. We will replicate the method used by Global Witness to estimate the total value of jade produced in 2014, proceeding step-by-step in order to understand what the data tells us and what is unclear.</p>
              
              <p>Working in our favor is two extra years' of additional data since the Global Witness report, as well as more detailed made available by the Myanmar Gems Enterprise (MGE).</p>
              
              <p>Before we begin, let's break down what information we need in order to calculate the value of jade. We start with this very simple formula:</p>
              
              <img src="assets/img/value_formula.png" width="100%"/><br/>
              
              <p>It's simple enough to begin with. If we can find out how much jade was produced, and what price it was sold at, we can calculate its value. But it gets complicated once we take into account the fact that not all jade is created equal – there are 3 types, and some are much more valuable than others.</p>
              
              <p>As for the quantity produced, we only have data on the total amount of jade produced, not how much of each type is produced. Moreover, we don't know the prices for the different types of jade that are sold in the entire sector, but only for the stones that are sold at official government gems and jade emporiums. These only account for a small fraction of the total jade produced each year.</p>
              
              <img src="assets/img/value_formula_annote.png" width="100%"/><br/>
              
              <p>In addition to all these uncertainties, the quantities, prices and value of the jade sector also fluctuate significantly from year to year.</p>
              
              <h3>Fluctuations: 2014 was a special year</h3>   

              <p>We began by looking at Global Witness' highest estimate that the total value of jade produced in 2014 could have been up to US$31 billion. At first glance, you might think that this estimate for 2014 is comparable to the sector’s value in other years too, but this is not necessarily the case.</p>
              
              <p>First, let's look at how the total quantity of jade produced varies from year to year. Myanmar's Central Statistical Office compiles this data, and it is also the same data that Global Witness used in their calculations. We can see that 2014 marks the lowest quantity produced in about a decade.</p>

              <p>Next, let's look at how the prices fluctuate. We don't have the average prices for the sector as a whole, but we do have the average price of uncut/unprocessed jade that was exported to China from the UN's trade statistics. Prices of jade exports climbed steeply in 2013 and 2014 but came crashing down in 2015.</p>
              
            <iframe id="datawrapper-chart-oR0UD" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/oR0UD/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;" height="452"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">if("undefined"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper["oR0UD"]={},window.datawrapper["oR0UD"].embedDeltas={"100":678,"200":544,"300":491,"400":491,"500":466,"700":452,"800":452,"900":452,"1000":452},window.datawrapper["oR0UD"].iframe=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-oR0UD"),window.datawrapper["oR0UD"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper["oR0UD"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper["oR0UD"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+"px",window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if("undefined"!=typeof a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var b in a.data["datawrapper-height"])if("oR0UD"==b)window.datawrapper["oR0UD"].iframe.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"});</script><br/><br/>
            
            
              <p>Finally, let's look at the total value of exports to China. Since we cannot directly see the total value of the whole sector, the next best thing is to see how much of it is officially exported to the largest market. In 2014, the total value of jade exports to China increased tenfold from the previous year, and quickly decreased by a similar amount in the year after.</p>
            
            
            <iframe id="datawrapper-chart-JRF1Z" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JRF1Z/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;" height="426"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">if("undefined"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper["JRF1Z"]={},window.datawrapper["JRF1Z"].embedDeltas={"100":658,"200":507,"300":454,"400":440,"500":426,"700":426,"800":426,"900":426,"1000":412},window.datawrapper["JRF1Z"].iframe=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-JRF1Z"),window.datawrapper["JRF1Z"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper["JRF1Z"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper["JRF1Z"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+"px",window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if("undefined"!=typeof a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var b in a.data["datawrapper-height"])if("JRF1Z"==b)window.datawrapper["JRF1Z"].iframe.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"});</script><br/><br/>
            
            
              <p>This goes to show that 2014 is a pretty atypical year for the jade sector. Therefore, whatever methods we use to estimate the value of jade produced in that year, we can safely assume that the total value for other years will be significantly lower. With that in mind, we go back to our calculations of the value of the jade sector in 2014.</p>
              
              <p>But before we dive into the numbers, we need two pieces of context: what are the types of jade and how is jade officially sold?</p>
              
              <h3>What are the types of jade?</h3>
              
              <p>Commodities such as gold or oil have for each unit that are more or less standardized. Each piece of jade, on the other hand, is unique, and putting a price on it is a very complicated and subjective process. </p>
              
              <p>Jade mined in Myanmar is composed of the mineral jadeite. It can be found in stones that vary in size, from as small as a pebble to boulders that are taller than a person. Every stone has distinct hues and patterns. In addition, it is very hard to tell the exact quality of a stone that has not been cut because you need to examine its internal structure of to determine the quality.</p>
              
              <p>However, there are three broad categories that jade produced in Myanmar is divided into:</p>
              
              <p><span class='ijade'>Imperial jade</span> is the most valuable and is made into high-end jewellry.<br/>
              <span class='cjade'>Commercial jade</span> is usually made into carvings and bangles and is of medium quality.<br/>
              <span class='ujade'>Utility jade</span> is the lowest grade, and is used for tilings and carvings, as well as cheap jewellry.</p>
              
              <p>Even this seperation into three categories is simplistic, because there are many subdivisions with each of these categories. For instance, utility jade is classified into A, B, C, and D grades; and there is a great deal of variation in quality within imperial jade and commercial as well.</p>
              
              <p>What we would ideally like to know is, out of the total quantity of jade produced, what percentage of that figure is imperial, commercial and utility jade respectively.</p>
              
              <p>Harvard Ash Center and Proximity Designs conducted an assessment of the Myanmar jade industry in 2013. Based on interviews with industry leaders, they estimated that the percentage composition of the various types of jade is as follows:</p>
              
              <img src="assets/img/jade_type_percentages_HarProx2013.png" width="100%"/><br/>
              
              <p>That same research group published another study in 2016 where they did a similar series of interviews with industry leaders, and found a very different percentage composition of the 3 types of jade, with imperial jade accounting for merely 0.01%.</p>
              
              <img src="assets/img/jade_type_percentages_HarProx2016.png" width="100%"/><br/>
              
              <p>The first of these percentage estimates were used in Global Witness' estimates since Harvard/Proximity's 2016 study had not come out yet. In conjunction with this estimate, Global Witness derived another set of percentages from the jade sold at the official emporiums. We will now look at how percentages were derived from emporium data, and what actually goes on at an emporium.</p>

              
              <h3>Emporiums: how is jade officially sold?</h3>
              
              <p>Every year, one or two large Gems Emporiums are held in Naypyitaw, Myanmar's capital. They are organised by MGE, a state owned enterprise that is responsible for both regulating the jade and gemstones sector, as well as production of jade and gems through joint venture arrangements with private companies.</p>
              
              <p>Foreigners are not allowed by Myanmar law to operate in the country's jade and gems sector. The major jade mining regions are also off limits to foreigners. The emporiums are therefore the only official channel where international buyers can purchase Myanmar jade and gems. The vast majority of foreign buyers come from China.</p>
              
              <p>During an emporium, jade and gemstones are grouped into lots and auctioned over the course of several days. The winners of the auction have to pay a deposit of 5% of the price of the lot and are given 90 days to claim the lot they successfully bid on.</p>
              
              <p>Global Witness' 2015 report consolidated data from industry sources about the quantity of jade that was sold in emporiums from 2005 to 2014. After the end of each emporium, an official press statement is released announcing the quantity and value of jade sold at the auctions. What is important to note is that this data shows the total amount that was bid by buyers. This means the buyer has paid the 5% deposit for the jade but may or may not have paid the remaining sum in order to redeem the jade.</p>
              
              <p>MGE has provided us with additional detailed data showing how much of the jade was actually fully paid for during the 90-day period – and it turns out that the amount of jade that is fully paid for and redeemed can be significantly less than the amount that was initially auctioned. We have data for the amounts that were fully paid for and redeemed for emporiums from 2011 to 2016. The graph below shows the two different quantities from 2011 to 2014 – the years for which we have data for both auctioned and redeemed amounts.</p>
              
              <iframe id="datawrapper-chart-bc07b" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/bc07b/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">if("undefined"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper["bc07b"]={},window.datawrapper["bc07b"].embedDeltas={"100":746,"200":531,"300":453,"400":414,"500":414,"700":400,"800":375,"900":375,"1000":375},window.datawrapper["bc07b"].iframe=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-bc07b"),window.datawrapper["bc07b"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper["bc07b"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper["bc07b"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+"px",window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if("undefined"!=typeof a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var b in a.data["datawrapper-height"])if("bc07b"==b)window.datawrapper["bc07b"].iframe.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"});</script>
              <br/><br/>
              
              
              <p>The aggregate quantities sold are not the most useful piece of information that we can get from emporium data. What we really want is the split in percentages between the three types of jade. Global Witness obtained the data for the percentage split for the 2014 emporium for the auctioned jade and it was as follows:</p>
             
              <img src="assets/img/jade_type_percentages_GW2014.png" width="100%"/><br/>
              
              <p>We now have another estimate from the data provided by MGE for the jade that was actually paid for and redeemed. In this estimate, the percentage of imperial jade is only 0.005%, much closer to the 2016 Harvard/Proximity study's estimate. There seems to be quite a bit of imperial jade that was not redeemed after the auction.</p>
              
              <img src="assets/img/jade_type_percentages_MGE2014.png" width="100%"/><br/>
    
              <p>Now that we have four very different estimates of the percentage splits, you can see why there is a lot of uncertainty in the process of estimating the value of the jade sector. There is also a lot of uncertainty in the estimation of prices. Emporium data can tell us the average price of each category of jade that was auctioned and sold, as seen here:</p>
              
              <img src="assets/img/jade_price.png" width="100%"/><br/>

              
              <p>To recap, the following two tables show the data that we have used from the emporiums to help us estimate the total value of Myanmar's jade industry.</p>

              <p>Now we are ready to dive into the actual estimates.</p>

              <h3>Recalculating Global Witness' estimates</h3>

              <p>Let's go back to our formula for calculating the total value and update it with how we might be able to get estimates for quantities and prices.</p>

              <img src="assets/img/value_formula_annote_2.png" width="100%"/><br/>

              <p>Although we do not have price and quantity data broken down by type of jade for the entire sector, we can come up with estimates for quantity of each type of jade using data from emporiums, and information from industry experts. We can also use average prices of each type of jade from emporium data to assume that the overall jade market has the same price structure.</p>

              <p>Let's see how we can use these quantity and price estimates to calculate the total value. For example, suppose we have <span class="ijade">1kg of imperial jade valued at $20,000 per kg</span>, <span class="cjade">5kg of commercial jade valued at $2,000 per kg</span>, and <span class="ujade">20kg of utility jade valued at $200 per kg</span>.</p>

              <img src="assets/img/jade_calc_example.png" width="100%"/><br/>

              <p>We know from the Myanmar Statistical Organisation's official figures that a <strong>total of 16,684,386 kg of jade</strong> was produced in fiscal year 2014.</p>

              <p>First, we will try to re-calculate Global Witness' estimates, using both the 2013 Harvard/Proximity percentage split and their 2014 emporium auctions percentage split.</p>


              <p>Using the 2013 Harvard/Proximity percentage split and 2014 emporium auction prices, we get <br><span class="ijade">5% imperial jade = 834,219 kg, valued at $19,491.97 per kg</span>,<br> <span class="cjade">35% commercial jade = 5,839,535 kg, valued at $2,213.89 per kg</span>,<br> and <span class="ujade">60% utility jade = 10,010,632 kg, valued at $505.52 per kg</span>.</p>
              
              <img src="assets/img/jade_calc_GW_HP2013.png" width="100%"/><br/>

              <p>Using the 2014 emporium auctions percentage split and 2014 emporium auction prices, we get <br><span class="ijade">1.49% imperial jade = 248,597 kg, valued at $19,491.97 per kg</span>,<br> <span class="cjade">11.33% commercial jade = 1,890,341 kg, valued at $2,213.89 per kg</span>,<br> and <span class="ujade">87.18%% utility jade = 84,342,908 kg, valued at $505.52 per kg</span>.</p>

              <img src="assets/img/jade_calc_GW_emporium2014.png" width="100%"/><br/>

              <p>These two estimates, <strong>US$34.2 billion</strong> and <strong>US$16.4 billion</strong>, are not far off from Global Witness' estimates. Their calculations yielded <strong>US$34.25 billion</strong> and <strong>US$15.45 billion</strong> for the emporium percentage split and the Harvard/Proximity percentage split respectively.</p>

              <p>The Global Witness report then incorporates more sales data from another local jade fair that was organised in 2014, and applies the Harvard/Proximity 2013 percentage split again to this expanded dataset to arrive at what they considered to be the most accurate estimate for the value of the jade sector, which was <strong>US$31 billion</strong>.</p>

              <h3>Can we get better estimates with new data?</h3>

              <p>It has been about three years since Global Witness' report was published, and we now have new data from industry experts and official details about emporiums from MGE. Following the same method that Global Witness used, can we see if the new data produces a better estimate of the value of jade for 2014 – the year that Myanmar jade was the most highly valued?</p>

              <p>First, we will use the 2016 Harvard/Proximity percentage splits, with the average prices from the 2014 emporium sales data from MGE. Applying this percentage split to the 16,684,386 kg of jade produced, we get <br><span class="ijade">0.01% imperial jade = 1,668 kg, valued at $871,808.57 per kg</span>,<br> <span class="cjade">3.5% commercial jade = 583,954 kg, valued at $2,675.35 per kg</span>,<br> and <span class="ujade">96.49% utility jade = 16,098,764 kg, valued at $203.55 per kg</span>.</p>

              <img src="assets/img/jade_calc_MGE_HP2016.png" width="100%"/><br/>

              <p>Next, we will use both the prices and percentage splits from 2014 emporium sales data from MGE. Applying this percentage split to the 16,684,386 kg of jade produced, we get <br><span class="ijade">0.00463% imperial jade = 772 kg, valued at $871,808.57 per kg</span>,<br> <span class="cjade">6.05481% commercial jade = 1,010,208 kg, valued at $2,675.35 per kg</span>,<br> and <span class="ujade">93.94056% utility jade = 15,673,406 kg, valued at $203.55 per kg</span>.</p>

              <img src="assets/img/jade_calc_MGE_emporium2014.png" width="100%"/><br/>
              
              <p>Compared to Global Witness' two initial estimates of <strong>US$34.25 billion</strong> and <strong>US$15.45 billion</strong>, our two values <strong>US$6.3 billion</strong> and <strong>US$6.6 billion</strong>, have a much narrower gap. They are however, about two to five times smaller than Global Witness' estimates.</p>

              <p>There are two other points of comparison to make. First is the value of jade imports to China in 2014, which stands at <strong>US$12.8 billion</strong> – the Global Witness report takes this as the lower bound for the value of the jade sector in 2014. It might be the case, however, that jade produced in one year might be exported in another year, and given that prices were increasing up to 2014, exporters might have been selling all their stockpiles from previous years. Secondly, when Global Witness calculated their US$31 billion final figure using the expanded data from the local jade fair, they actually obtained two values. One was US$31 billion, which they got from applying the Harvard/Proximity 2013 percentages, and another was US$5.64 billion, which is obtained when applying the percentage split from the 2014 emporium auction data. This figure, which Global Witness dismissed as impossible because it was below their lower bound of US$12.8 billion, is actually much closer to our own estimates.</p>

              <p>We are still barely scratching the surface when it comes to actually figuring out what the real value of Myanmar's jade is, but with more data made available through transparency initiatives, we may get closer to the true figure in the near future.</p>
